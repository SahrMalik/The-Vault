      <p>The topics listed in this page are subjects that I have put 
      some research into that I believe possess metaphysical insights. Particularly
      about our reality; how it works; and possibly why we humans are here
      and where we are heading. I'm not claiming this list of topics and ideas containe
      all the truths; but I do believe they will lead to a better understanding
      of at least a portion of truth.
